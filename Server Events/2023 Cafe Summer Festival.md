Hi everyone. Hope you all are having a fabulous day! After completing the channel server revamp, we are excited to announce that our server is **back in business**! :GanyuNote:  _Did you also know that it's officially our server's **3-year anniversary** the time I post this announcement?_ :YaeMikoHeh:  @everyone 
### **__INTRODUCING 2023 CAFE SUMMER FESTIVAL__**

Whenever #üçû‚îächill-chat is active, a random event will occur, and all of you will have a chance to win :MORA: (fake) mora! This currency can then be used to advance your level in @Arcane#7800. **Every 2 :MORA: will be converted into 1 XP by the end of the event in around late August (capped at level 100).** Find out more at https://arcane.bot/calculator.

*** :Keqing_note: You can check your mora inventory by using </mora:1113523731122372618> and the leaderboard by using </lb:1113525545523748935>.***

> _Moreover, we are working to enhance our bot channels to make it safer for everyone in the community. We will be reset all card data in @Mudae#0807 in this server within this week.  We do acknowledge the amount of time and effort it took to obtain your cards, however, this issue cannot go unattended. I hope you all understand._ :VentiPray: 

**This is just the BEGINNING of the event!** Throughout the summer, events will gradually roll out. Sneak peeks will be present in the `Events` tab (it's actually already there), so stay tuned here. :Dilucool:

We hope you are as excited as we are! **Don't forget to say hi in #üçû‚îächill-chat!** ‡∂û

**Update on Jun 2:** You can now donate your mora to a friend using </donate:1114330462802940024> command! New events will be and have been rolling out gradually as well! Keep an eye on chat!
