Hi everyone. Hope you all are having a fabulous day! After completing the channel server revamp, we are excited to announce that our server is **back in business**!  _Did you also know that it's officially our server's **3-year anniversary** the time I post this announcement?_ 
### **__INTRODUCING 2023 CAFE SUMMER FESTIVAL__**

Whenever #üçû‚îächill-chat is active, a random event will occur, and all of you will have a chance to win (fake) mora! This currency can then be used to advance your level in Arcane. **Every 5 mora will be converted into 1 XP by the end of the event in around late August (capped at level 100).** Find out more at https://arcane.bot/calculator.

*** You can check your mora inventory by using `/mora` and the leaderboard by using `/lb`.***

> _Moreover, we are working to enhance our bot channels to make it safer for everyone in the community. We will be reset all card data in @Mudae#0807 in this server within this week.  We do acknowledge the amount of time and effort it took to obtain your cards, however, this issue cannot go unattended. I hope you all understand._ 

**This is just the BEGINNING of the event!** Throughout the summer, events will gradually roll out. Sneak peeks will be present in the `Events` tab (it's actually already there), so stay tuned here.

We hope you are as excited as we are! **Don't forget to say hi in #üçû‚îächill-chat!** ‡∂û

The top 3 members with the most mora by the end of the event will earn the esteemed `@Special Event Winners` role forever too.

### **Update on Jun 2:** 
- You can now donate your mora to a friend using `/donate` command! New events will be and have been rolling out gradually as well! Keep an eye on chat!

### **Important Update on Jun 23 regarding 2023 Summer Cafe Event:**
- You can now use `/buy` to purchase an item using your precious mora. To view a list of all the items, use `/shop`.
- To check your items, you can use the `/mora` command. It will display your mora balance as well as all your purchased items.
- The items are likely to be permanent exclusive roles, so YOU CAN ONLY OBTAIN THESE ROLES NOW!

### Update on Jun 28: 
You can now utilize the `/customize` command to personalize your mora inventory background. Keep in mind that your uploaded images will be automatically cropped, maintaining a ratio of 720x256 pixels instead of being scaled. We recommended you select an image with a similar shape to the new `/mora` inventory image. Each customization will have a cost of 5000 mora.
