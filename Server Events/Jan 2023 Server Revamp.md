## Team Details & Team Challenges

### Team Selection Details:

* Members can freely join, switch or leave teams from the start to the 15th day of the month, but no longer can switch, join or leave teams when a team challenge is happening.

### Team Challenges Details:

* Happens once a month from the 15th day to the end of the month.

* The goal is for team members to work collectively towards a goal (the fastest team to reach the goal/the highest or best among all the teams), not competing for the best individual in the team.

* If a team wins the challenge for the previous month, they will be awarded the title "Team of the Month" for that month as well as +1 "Team Trophy".

* At the end of the year, the team with the most "Team Trophy" will win an exclusive custom role applied to all members, as well as an exclusive prize (TBC).

* At the end of the year, the person with the most "Credits" will get an exclusive role as well as an exclusive prize (TBC)

* The maximum number of team members in each team is currently 30.

### Team Leaders' Requirements:

* Must be level 50+ in the server.

* Must have a good record of behavior in the server.

* Must be able to commit to leading the team for an extensive period of time.

### Team Leaders' Privilege & Restrictions:

* Can freely transfer team leadership to any team member at any given moment.

* Have manage channels and manage message permissions in his or her team's private chat channel.

* If his or her team wins a challenge, he or she can recommend the next challenge for the month. Leaders can select challenges possibly favorable to their own team as long as it does not violate the rules of the server nor violate the [principles or purpose of team challenges](https://bip.so/genshin/2023-server-revamp-39025c?blockUUID=8903ffb6-31f6-4d23-a885-a9aac711d242). Server owners will try to honor your request whenever possible.

* Cannot leave their own team unless it is [officially deleted](https://bip.so/genshin/2023-server-revamp-39025c?blockUUID=afbc7a62-b0f0-4975-b632-b608ee75f438)/[the team leadership is officially transferred](https://bip.so/genshin/2023-server-revamp-39025c?blockUUID=3b1a0c64-bc88-4797-a500-36dc78917f91).

* Must maintain as a good role model and act in good faith in the server.

* Do not annoy people when advertising within or outside the server. Appropriate recruitment is okay. 

### Team Members' Privilege:

* Access to a private team chat channel.

* If the team he or she belongs to wins a monthly challenge, he or she will win 5 extra levels in Arcane as well as 5 "Credits".

* Can collectively decide to overthrow a team leader with 90% of existing team members upvoting (the new team leader will be the one with the highest level/XP in Arcane before the vote).

### Team Deletion Process:

Team deletion is a huge matter, especially if your team has a large number of team members. Please talk to one of our owners directly before leaving or abandoning your team to see if we can work things out, most likely by having you transfer your leadership to someone else. 

### Owners reserve the following rights:

* Remove or transfer the team leadership to anyone else if deemed necessary

* Disagree with the winning team leader's suggestion for the next challenge

* Remove Credits from anyone if deemed necessary

* Move anyone from one team to another if one team has a disproportionately large number of team members and may lead to unfairness

* Increase the maximum number of team members in each team at anytime

## Monthly Server Update

We plan to release a new server update (with cool new existing systems or features) every month. We do not want to release everything at once, but we certainly do not want to release garbage to the server that no one wants.

It would be awesome to plan ahead for at least half a year.
