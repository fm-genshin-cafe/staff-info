## Monthly Server Update

We plan to release a new server update (with cool new existing systems or features) every month. We do not want to release everything at once, but we certainly do not want to release garbage to the server that no one wants. It would be awesome to plan ahead for at least half a year.

January: Introduction of Team Challenges
February: Minor Channel & Server Revamps done by Hunter
March: Rebuilding the server since it got raided
April: Minor updates in bumping + vanity on the status system
May: Major Channel & Server Revamps done by Ian
June: Minor Channel & Server Revamps

## Details (Completed)
* Role for Karuta player from Keqing bot 
* Application for VC Moderator
* Emote & Stickers Credits
* Advertising for Diluc VA event in other servers
* Starboard function of Carl-bot
* Add more music bots
* New server booster + level 100 only chat
* System to prevent Karuta lurkers
* Add a rep system to #coop-helping
* Remove #bump-the-cafe and #vote-for-us channel since itâ€™s virtually useless (not removing on DISBOARD nor top.gg though)
