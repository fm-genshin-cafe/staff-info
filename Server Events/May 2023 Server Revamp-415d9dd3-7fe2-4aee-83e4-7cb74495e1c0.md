## Monthly Server Update

We plan to release a new server update (with cool new existing systems or features) every month. We do not want to release everything at once, but we certainly do not want to release garbage to the server that no one wants. It would be awesome to plan ahead for at least half a year.

January: Introduction of Team Challenges

February: Minor Channel & Server Revamps done by Hunter

March: N/A

April: N/A

May: ???

June: ???
