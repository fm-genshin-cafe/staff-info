## Done
- Completed #about-us
- New #anime-talk, #media-and-creation #teapot-terrace channels
- #artworks converted to media channel
- Team Fontaine is added on September 1
- Server Subscripions are released

## To-do
- Build experts choose new build experts system
- Appeal system for banned user
- Mudae
  - All mudae users must be active in the last 30 days.
  - Every 30 days there will be a command rolled, if you weren’t active your list gets cleared
  - If found only rolling once every 30 days to keep your account you will be denied mudae access

## Considering 
- Verification system
  - ✅Avoid raids and better equipped against bots
  - ❌A barrier for new members to engage, negatively affecting member retention
  - ❌Permissions are already well setup, unless staff members decide to invite malicious hackers, a raid won’t happen
  - ❌AutoMod also already blocks spam content
- Theorycrafting/lore channel 
  - Do we allow spoilers?
- Make something better than the former cafe forum channel 
- Content Creator
  - More Benefits to Content Creators + Exclusive Channel to Daily post Videos
  - Bring back #genshin-content (for video advertising) channel
  - Content Creator role application & requirements
- Family Tree for the server
  - ✅People like roleplaying, fulfilling user demand
  - ❌A weird system in general that’s not really necessary
- A channel where people can share works of writing, like poems, songs, and stories - similar to how people can post artworks
- A multimedia/memes channel
- A giveaway + donation (aka real money) sponsor system / Server Subscription
- Region friend ping similar to co-op
