> About the [team] challenge, maybe we could do a dmg challenge all teams fight the same boss so it's fair and they take a picture of the dmg they do and someone adds it all up and which every team has the highest dmg wins?

## Details

Every team gets to fight the same boss. The highest number they hit during that will be the number we'll count (we could watch them or just ask for a screenshot).

The team with the highest damage in each round will receive 1 point. The player who did the damage will receive 3 Team Credits.

The team in the end with the highest points will be declared the winner for this month's challenge and will be rewarded with 1 Team Trophy, as well as all members will be rewarded with 5 Team Credits.
