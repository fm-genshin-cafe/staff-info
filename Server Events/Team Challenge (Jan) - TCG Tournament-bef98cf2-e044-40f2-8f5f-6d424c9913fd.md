# Workflow

* As many participants from each them can select the time slots they want to compete in.

* Staff will review registered participants, and randomly assign them into the brackets if 4 members from 4 different teams can be found and filled in

* Contestants can swap with teammates from other time slots if there are any teammates willing to do so at all

* Contestants will be notified and reminded in advance about their designated time slot

* Staff will follow the timetable accordingly, ask and grant permissions to the contestants to stream in the VC

    * Contestants must be able to stream real-time gameplay

    * Another staff member will screen record the stream

    * Only one match at a time

* Once the game has ended, another staff member will be notified to update the real time brackets / contestant information

# Timeslots

The tournament will take place from Jan 15 to Jan 31, therefore, the time slots can span over this time period.

Since  **Roles 3-6** require simultaneous interaction and have to work together during the same time, it is essential to come up with time slots that convenience both contestants and staff members

Note that multiple matches may happen in the same time slot. It all depends on the assignment of  **Role 1** .

>  **What do you need to do?** 
- Come up with a convenient time slot for you during Jan 15-31 (must dedicate 1-2 hours during that time)
- See if your preferred time slot already existed, if not, edit any [TIME SLOT X] with your preferred date and time
- Look over  **Role 1-6** , type your name if you wish to be responsible for it. 

> If you really don't have an available time slot to dedicate your time to, please come up with an alternative role that you can serve and DM Ian. 

> Time is in  **Pacific Time**  (UTC -8)

>  ***Please select as many responsibilities in as many time slots as you can. Right now we are short on staff***
