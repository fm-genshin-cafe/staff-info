🎤 We've got a fun challenge lined up for us In July - "Guess the Voice - Team Challenge", where competitors listen to different voicelines from Genshin characters and try to guess which character they belong to. 🎮🎉

This challenge is an extension of an event we're already excited about, where Sean Chiplock, the voice of Diluc, will be hosting a talk in the same month! We can't wait to hear more about the behind-the-scenes of Genshin and how Sean brings our favorite characters to life. 👀

The team with the most correct guesses at the end of the challenge will be crowned the winner and will get bragging rights until our next challenge!
