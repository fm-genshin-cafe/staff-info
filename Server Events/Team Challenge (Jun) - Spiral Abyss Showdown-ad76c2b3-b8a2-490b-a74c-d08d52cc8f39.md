The "Spiral Abyss Showdown: A Genshin Impact Speedrun Challenge Event" is a competition where players attempt to complete the Spiral Abyss as fast as possible. The Spiral Abyss is a challenging dungeon in Genshin Impact that requires players to defeat waves of enemies and bosses within a limited amount of time.

To participate in the event, players must form teams of four and register for the competition. Once registered, teams will be given a specific date and time to attempt the Spiral Abyss, and will have a set amount of time to complete as many floors as possible.

The team that completes the most floors in the fastest time will be declared the winner of the event. In the event of a tie, the team with the fastest completion time for the last floor will be declared the winner.

To ensure a fair competition, all teams must stream their attempts to a Discord VC, and must have a moderator present to verify their completion times.

The event can be hosted multiple times, allowing players to compete against each other and attempt to beat their own records. Rewards can be given to the winning team, such as in-game items or Discord server roles.
