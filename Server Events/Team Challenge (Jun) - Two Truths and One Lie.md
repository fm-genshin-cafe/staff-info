Extending our 2023 Summer Cafe Chellenge going on, we would like to present you our latest challenge in ‚Å†üçû‚îächill-chat: **Two Truths And A Lie**

* The objective is simple. When someone enters three statements, you determine which one is a lie. That's literally it.
* Please enter real facts and real lies (sorry lies cant be real my bad) so other members can learn more about you!
* Each event you get correct will earn you 1 extra Team Credit. Of course, this challenge might come with some bugs. Please ping me in your team channels if you encounter any issues with screenshots! (Note your team credits by using /team mine now to avoid unintended bugs)
* This event will drop randomly like other events. Be patient, and make chat active. The more active the chat is, the higher chance the event will appear. Good luck.
