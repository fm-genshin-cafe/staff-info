Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

We are hosting "Bosses Through the Lens: A Genshin Impact Photography Event", where you take photos of bosses in Genshin Impact and submit them at <#1102312540903579650>! ðŸ“·ðŸŽ‰

Event starts from now until May 30, you can only submit one screenshots. Since they must be original screenshots, your UID must be visible in the screenshot. 

We are looking for creativity, composition, and overall screenshot quality. We will evaluate the submissions based on the scale 1 to 10, and for the team scores, we simply add up all their team members' submission scores. The team with the highest total score wins this month's challenge! ðŸŒŸ

Can't wait to see all the epic screenshots! ðŸ¤©
