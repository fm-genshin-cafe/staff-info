## General Rule: Be Active & Helpful 

#  **1) Be Friendly** 

 **Friendliness**  is one of the main core values of our server. Even when people don't treat you with respect or kindness, it is important to remember to  **be polite and respectful**  towards them in order to remain professional and maintain good relationships with server members. 

The  **"customer is always right" policy**  is a good guideline to use when it comes to dealing with customers. It is important to  **listen to their concerns**  or feedback and to try and provide them with a  **satisfactory resolution** .  

> Do not start any meaningless arguments or dramas with server members. This will deteriorate our server image and lead to greater dissatisfaction and hatred towards the whole staff team.

We urge staff to cherish every member of the community. While the fact that inviting one member is already hard enough, we still have to grow fast on a long-term basis. We do not tolerate any kind of action which directly or indirectly causes any members to leave, for example, treating them without respect or starting an argument.

It is also important to remember that even though people may not treat you with respect, you should still  **treat them with kindness and respect** . There may be underlying reasons for why someone is behaving in a certain way, and it is important to try to understand those reasons and to be patient and understanding.  

Overall,  **be calm, friendly, and professional** . Do not sink to their level, but instead remain calm and polite and try to resolve the situation in a peaceful and respectful manner. 

# 2) Dealing with Tricky Situations

We allow the front line of staff to  **make judgment calls**  to create an environment where everyone is working to help the members, rather than making them feel helpless in being empathetic and accommodating to members. 

By allowing staff to bend the rules, staff will feel empowered to bypass a policy if it is in line with the server's core values (friendly, transparency, etc). It also will keep them from feeling enslaved to strict rules and sending every member’s complaint to the owner. However, it does not mean that we simply allow staff to give away the goods; It means allowing staff to make judgment calls based on individual situations.  **By handling special situations rather than sending them along, the front line of staff will save moderation time and energy.** 

Let's take a look at [this YouTube advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWDocNUskPA) you might have seen before as an example:

> Don't be like that weird lemonade salesperson chatbot, who simply does not know how to respond to unexpected situations like refunds.

# 3) Be Official & Formal

When dealing with things that are related to the server, such as answering a ticket inquiry, remember you are  **writing on behalf of the server** .  

Say “please”, “sorry and “thank you”. Being polite can express your gratitude to members. 

Say “please” if you ask somebody for a favor or request. For instance, “Would you please send us your YouTube channel link for verification for the Content Creator role?” 

Say “thank you” if somebody grants a favor, grants a request, or compliments you. For example, “Thank you for your attention!”  

> Nevertheless, when chatting normally, just be yourself. Don't step across the boundaries and you could talk as informally as you want to.

In addition, try to  **avoid short forms or slang**  as it is very bad-looking. Instead, you should type with proper punctuation, capital letters and greeting words. Staff must act professionally and maturely. 

# 4) Have Transparency

It is the unfortunate reality of a huge server that it is not always possible to accommodate every member’s request. Members can become irritating and unreasonable. Sometimes too many members have too many requests. In these cases, sticking to a “customer is always right” policy can have a detrimental effect on the server.   

When you cannot give the member what they want, it is important to  **give them a clear reason why**  and  **handle the situation with transparency** . Members want to feel heard and considered even if their requests are not granted. Most members will be more understanding if they are given a reason. 

>  _Harvard conducted an experiment in which three types of people asked to cut in line for a copy machine: one that simply asked to cut, one that asked to cut because he was in a rush, and one that simply explained he needed to cut to make copies. In the first version, 60% of people let him cut. In the second, 94% of people allowed the researcher to cut and 93% of people let the researcher in the third version cut, even though he gave a non-reason._ 

As the study demonstrates, the reason itself is not as important as simply having one. Even if it may not make much sense to the members, they will often appreciate the transparency. But then, the staff obviously should have a reasonable reason for members instead of a non-reason.   

Besides, called the labor illusion, members will not be upset waiting if they feel that they are not being ignored and can see that work is being done for them. Transparency can overcome many customer service hurdles and will put the customer at ease. We urge staff not to ignore any members’ requests and let them know that we are on it. 

> However, if you don’t know how to encounter “unanswerable questions”, refer to the following section.

#  5) Unanswerable Questions

If you encounter a question from members that you are not sure how to answer,  **DO NOT guide people to the owners immediately**  such as telling them to “ask Ian” or "idk ask kitsune".  **This will make members very confused and helpless.** 

> While you don’t know the answer, try replying something like “This is a tricky question, I will get back to you right away”.

This makes members understand and they will be more patient. After that, remember to fetch answers from the owner and get back to the member as soon as possible with formal language. 

If you encounter any unanswerable questions in tickets, simply stay put and reply nothing since the owner will eventually come online  _(you may also go to some other staff channels and ping the owner regarding this)_ . 

> Do not ever say in tickets like "wait for ian to come to answer" as this makes us very chaotic and unorganized. 

Besides, certain affairs such as giveaway sponsors and large-scale partners (not normal server partnership) should not be decided by any staff. Please hand over the situation to the owner immediately. 

# 6) Server Moderation

Server Moderation includes making changes to the server itself, which only includes making changes to roles, channels, and basic info of the server. 

> If you wish to work on any of these, prior permission from the owner must be obtained.  **If you’ve been found making changes to the server without permission, you will be demoted.**  

However, remember we allow the front line of staff to make judgment calls. If you notice, for example, some channels that should only be visible to staff members but for some reason they were still visible to everyone in the server, make sure to fix that or notify higher staff if you do not have the server permissions to do so as soon as possible.

In addition,  **do not get roles which you do not deserve** . Please ask for permission before you get the roles yourself or else you will be demoted immediately. Begging for roles and promotion is also strictly not allowed. Violation will result in a demotion. You will be promoted whenever you are suitable for and capable of getting a promotion.

Moreover, all promotions and demotions of staff members must go through at least one of our owners.  **You may not promote or demote any staff members even if you have the role permissions to do so.** Please do not assign responsibilities to your fellow staff members. You can only do that if you are  **explicitly asked or told by the owners to do so.** If you are unsure whether your actions are appropriate, please check in with one of our owners first before proceeding, otherwise, you risk the chance of demotion.  

# 7) Disciplinary Actions

As a staff, you’ve been granted the right to execute these actions according to your staff position. As a staff, you should not misuse these moderation tools. 

> Some servers’ moderators will ban people right away if you point out their wrongs or just slightly disrespect them. We DO NOT want to be those servers.

We urge you to execute these actions only if you believe it’s necessary. We want to give people as many chances and as less disciplinary actions as we can. If one unintentionally violates a rule once or twice, simply verbally let them know that it is not okay to do this in the server. 

Warns and mutes should only be given if members don’t follow the rules  **multiple times on purpose**  (basically can’t stop). Kicks and Bans should only be executed only if you believe that he or she is a threat to the well-being of the server (such as attempting to raid the server, or spamming unsolicited advertisements to server members' DMs). 

The different severity of disciplinary actions is as follows:

* Verbal warning

* Warn

* Timeout (generally-speaking better than mute)

* Kick

* Ban

 **Resolve an issue using the least severe disciplinary actions at all times, but completely prevent it from happening again.** Here are some common examples:

> New member spams messages / emotes / attachments

* First resort: Verbally warn him to see if he improves his behavior 

* Second resort: Timeout him if he continues to spam 

 _Verbal warnings do not completely prevent the member from spamming again, but we do not want to lose even one potential chatter in the server. Spamming in the chat is really not that serious and does not really affect others, and he deserves a chance to improve his behavior after knowing that spamming is not allowed. Note that we cannot resolve this issue using bot warnings if he continues to spam (he can still keep spamming after that), so the most reasonable way is to timeout him to prevent him from sending any content anymore. Also note that we don't need to resort to kicking or even banning as timing out is already good enough at preventing this rule-breaking behavior from happening again._ 

> Member spams inappropriate content in other member's DM (e.g. fake Nitro scams / inappropriate photos)

* First and only resort: Ban

 _The only solution is to ban him. Most of the time the reason why they do that is that their account got hacked. Spamming nearly everyone's DM is very annoying to members, and banning him would deem to be the most appropriate way._ 

There are countless other scenarios that you would encounter in the server every single day. In many other servers, the situation is often escalated after a punishment is enforced. Nevertheless, always respond to rule-breaking behaviors to show members that we will not allow them to go haywire and that the staff is not going to sit around while they break rules. It is therefore vital for you to be able to determine which punishment would be the best after taking many factors into consideration. 

> Do not use your power to enforce punishments as your leverage to server members. Try to use as less disciplinary actions as you possibly can, as if dealt with improperly, the situation would often be escalated.
